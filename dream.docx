You make my dreams come true.
Sung By Hall & Oats

What I want, you've got
But it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I got full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together
And how, I can't explain, oh yeah
Well, well, you (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You make my dreams come true (you, you)
You (you, you)
Well, well, well, you (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah, you make my dreams come true (ooh-ooh)
Girl, yeah (you, you)
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with a dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same, oh yeah
